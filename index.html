The aim of this project was to improve functional MRI input data to improve the classification accuracy of detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder in patients.

            <p class="project-desc">A replication project in financial machine learning papaer aimed at recreating an Out-of-Sample R² value, using neural networks for time-series financial data. This project introduced unique training-validation methods specific to financial data, furthering my skills in applying machine learning to finance. It was insightful using an increasing training set on time series data to make OOS monthly predictions. The financial data was extremely noisy and difficult to capture to a high standard. Seen below is the 3 layer ensemble neural network OOS predictions, with the results highlighting the difficulty of crafting a model which accounts for eradic variability. </p>

            <p class="project-desc">As part of a four-member team, I contributed to the design and testing of a wind turbine. We used Blade Element Momentum theory for airfoil selection and applied a genetic algorithm metaheuristic for optimal blade orientations and parameters. The turbine was built and tested across different wind speeds to validate performance, underscoring skills in team-based engineering and experimental validation. An image of my team and the wind turbine we built can be seen below:</p>
